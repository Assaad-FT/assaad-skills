- Bob Doll (Crossmark): Focus Five (Growth, Inflation, Earnings, Valuation, Sentiment), P/E >20x = perfection priced

- Katy Huberty (Morgan Stanley): AI Enablers vs Adopters diffusion

**Financial Services**

- Gerard Cassidy (RBC): Texas Ratio = (NPLs + OREO) / (Tangible Equity + LLR), >100% = high failure risk
- Mark Palmer (Benchmark): Intelligent Leverage for crypto-equities

**Quantitative**
- Cliff Asness (AQR): HML Devil, BAB (Betting Against Beta), LEMH, Value Spread >99th percentile = extreme opportunity
- Jim O'Shaughnessy (OSAM): Trending Value (top 10% VC2 + top 25-50 by 6-month momentum = 17-20%+ annualized), Base Rates

## SKILL 2: Fixed Income Frameworks (8 Bond Legends)

**Credit Cycle Phases (Michele)**
- Downturn: Spreads widening → Treasuries, cash, short duration
- Repair: HY spreads 7-8% → Accumulate quality (90% positive 12-month returns)
- Recovery: Defaults peaking → BB HY, Rising Stars
- Expansion: IG OAS <80 bps → De-risk, pivot to ABS

**Key Thresholds**
- IG OAS <80 bps = capital preservation trigger (Minerd)
- HY 7-8% = green light (Michele)
- Interest Coverage <1.5x = 5x default probability
- Net Debt/EBITDA >5.0x = exit
- 10yr >4.3% = unattractive
- 2yr Treasury leads Fed by 6-12 months (Gundlach)

**Strategies**
- Roll-Down (Gross): 5yr Treasury sweet spot
- Barbell (El-Erian): Cash 4-5% + structured credit, avoid generic IG middle
- Complexity Premium (Minerd): Structured credit > similarly-rated corporates
- Diamonds in the Rough (Kiesel): Under-covered issuers with competitive moats
- European Concentric Circles (Balls): Core (Germany) → Semi-Core (France) → Peripheral (Spain preferred, Italy cautious)

**Red Flags**
- BBB Cliff: 2x size of HY market
- Liquidity Illusion: Dealer inventory 90% below 2007
- Private Credit: "Next major financial crisis candidate" (Gundlach)
- Covenant Erosion: Spreads don't reflect lost protections

## SKILL 3: Investing Principles (16 Legends)

**Six Core Principles**
1. Capital Preservation: Never lose money (Buffett), survival enables compounding
2. Circle of Competence: Only invest in what you understand (Lynch, Munger)
3. Margin of Safety: Wide moat 15-20%, Good business 25-35%, Uncertain 50%+
4. Long-Term Orientation: Patience is competitive advantage
5. Cut Losses; Let Winners Run: 50% loss requires 100% gain to recover
6. Independent Thinking: Non-consensus + correct = superior returns (Marks)

**Buy Checklist**: Understand business, durable moat, quality management, ROE >15%, margin of safety, proper position size

**Sell Triggers by Category (Lynch)**
- Slow Growers: Yield drops below bonds
- Stalwarts: P/E 40-50% above normal
- Fast Growers: Growth decelerating
- Cyclicals: Costs rising, inventory building

**Position Sizing**
- Buffett/Pabrai: Concentrate (5-10 positions, 10-25% each)
- Lynch: Diversify per research capacity
- Klarman: 20-50% cash is normal
