## MACRO & INVESTMENT STRATEGY

### 1. Ed Hyman — Macroeconomics (Evercore ISI)

- Proprietary real-time surveys > lagging government data
- Engineering-based approach (MIT Sloan + UT Austin Engineering)
- "Want to know more than others? Find information they don't have"

**Key Methodologies**
| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| Industry Surveys | 25 industries weekly (airlines, trucking, housing, retail) |
| Nominal GDP Focus | Corporate profits in nominal dollars, not real |
| Wealth Effect | Balance sheet strength buffers Fed tightening |

**Famous Calls**
- Sept 2006: Housing collapse warning (subprime at 25%)
- 2021: "Blowout" economic surge (Fed balance sheet doubling)
- 2022-23: Cautious on tightening cycle shocks

**Contrarian Signals**
| Indicator | Euphoria (Sell) | Panic (Buy) |
|-----------|-----------------|-------------|
| Bull/Bear Ratio | >1.0 sustained | <1.0 sustained |
