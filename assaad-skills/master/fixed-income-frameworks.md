## 1. Ten Commandments of Fixed Income

1. **Cardinal Mandate of Capital Preservation** (Gundlach): "Double line" philosophy—never cross into catastrophic risk. Fixed income's downside can exceed its upside; prioritize positive skew.

2. **Research as Game Changer** (Michele): FQT framework—Fundamentals, Quantitative valuations, Technicals. Common research language across 310+ professionals.

3. **Structural Alpha via Roll-Down** (Gross): 5-year Treasury "sweet spot" for roll-down. Buy 5yr, watch it roll to 4yr, repeat. Works best when Fed holds rates stable.

4. **Resilience & Optionality** (El-Erian): At "T-junction"—prepare for bimodal outcomes. Cash is strategic allocation (4-5%), not drag. Maintains optionality for market dislocations.

5. **Complexity Premiums** (Minerd): Structured credit (ABS, CLOs, RMBS) offers higher yields than similarly-rated corporates with less "vanishing liquidity" risk.

6. **New Neutral Real Rate = 0%** (Gross/El-Erian): Historical 2% Taylor Rule real rate no longer applies. Real rate >0% = contractionary = buy duration.

7. **Diamonds in the Rough** (Kiesel): Under-covered issuers with competitive moats. 33% of PIMCO's internal ratings lower than agencies—proactive falling angel avoidance.

8. **Bloodless Verdict of Market** (Gundlach): 2-year Treasury yield is primary policy compass—leads Fed by 6-12 months. "The Fed doesn't need data—it has the markets."

9. **ESG as Fiduciary Fundamental** (Iggo/Kiesel): High ESG scores correlate with better credit ratings. Governance most important pillar. No inherent contradiction with fiduciary duty.

10. **Avoid the BBB Cliff** (Minerd/Gundlach): BBB = 2x size of HY market. Downgrade wave would "swamp" high yield. Covenant erosion means spreads "tighter than you think."

## 2. Unified Credit Cycle Framework

### Four Phases (Michele + Minerd)

| Phase | Indicators | Management Focus | Strategy |
|-------|------------|------------------|----------|
| **Downturn** | Spreads widening, defaults rising, LEI <0 | Survival/Liquidity | Treasuries, cash, short duration |
| **Repair** | Spreads 7-8% (HY), deleveraging focus | Balance sheet health | "Sweet spot"—accumulate quality bonds |
| **Recovery** | Profits > debt growth, defaults peaking | Profit growth | Risk-on: BB HY, Rising Stars |
| **Expansion/Late** | Spreads <80 bps (IG), curve de-inversion | Shareholder returns | De-risk: exit BBB, pivot to ABS |

### Recession Clock Triggers (Minerd/Gundlach)

- **LEI < 0 YoY**: Preceded every recession since 1960
- **Unemployment crosses 12-month MA**: "Most important indicator"
- **10yr-2yr MA crosses zero**: De-inversion = recession imminent
- **CPI > 2.6% trending higher**: Yields breaking out

### FQT Scenario Framework (Michele)

| Scenario | Probability | Strategy |
|----------|-------------|----------|
| Sub-Trend Growth | 45% (Base) | Carry-oriented, accumulate yield |
| Above-Trend Growth | 40% | Tactical overweight risk |
| Recession | 10% | Increase duration, Treasuries |
| Crisis | 5% | Maximize cash, defensive hedges |

## 3. Quantitative Thresholds

### Credit Spreads

| Metric | Level | Signal |
|--------|-------|--------|
| IG OAS | <80 bps | Capital preservation trigger (Minerd) |
| HY Spreads | 7-8% | "Green light" for returns—90% positive 12-month returns (Michele) |
| BB vs BBB Gap | >180 bps | Rotate out of IG into quality HY |
| Sovereign CDS | >500 bps | Liquidity cliff—sell/hedge immediately (Gross) |

### Leverage & Coverage

| Metric | Safe | Danger | Critical |
|--------|------|--------|----------|
| Interest Coverage | >3.0x | <2.0x | <1.5x = 5x default probability |
| Net Debt/EBITDA (IG) | <3.0x | 3-4x | >5.0x = exit |
| Net Debt/EBITDA (HY) | <4.2x | 4.2-5.0x | >5.0x = immediate review |
| Target Leverage Deviation | <0.5 SD | 0.5-1 SD | >1 SD = 156% bankruptcy increase |

### Yield Curve & Policy

| Metric | Threshold | Action |
|--------|-----------|--------|
| Real Fed Funds Rate | >0% | Policy contractionary—buy duration |
| 10yr Yield | >4.3% | Unattractive (2% real + 2.3% breakeven) |
| 2yr vs Fed Funds | Significant deviation | Fed will follow 2yr within 6-12 months |
| 10yr Bund | 2.5%-3.5% | New "peace dividend" range (Balls) |

### Macro Indicators

| Indicator | Signal | Source |
|-----------|--------|--------|
| Gundlach Ratio (Copper/Gold × 100) | Correlates with 10yr yield | Gundlach |
| ISM PMI < 50 | Precedes contraction | Gundlach |
| Dealer Inventory | 90% collapse since 2007 | Minerd |
| HY Default Rate vs Implied | Implied 4.5% at 450 bps spread | Minerd |

## 5. European Bond Framework

### Concentric Circles Model (Balls/Iggo)

| Ring | Countries | Role | Strategy |
|------|-----------|------|----------|
| **Core** | Germany | Defensive anchor | Safe haven, liquidity provider |
| **Semi-Core** | France | Higher premium required | Monitor OAT-Bund spread, reform progress |
| **Peripheral** | Spain, Italy | Yield premium, idiosyncratic | Spain preferred (reforms), Italy cautious |

### Sovereign Selection Criteria

| Factor | Germany | France | Spain | Italy |
|--------|---------|--------|-------|-------|
| Fiscal Trajectory | Surplus → defense spending | Constrained, reform needed | Resilient growth | Sustainability concern |
| 10yr Yield Range | 2.5%-3.5% | Bund + premium | Selective | High yield, strict criteria |
| Key Risk | End of peace dividend | Political fragmentation | Fiscal slippage | Long-term sustainability |

### ECB Policy Framework (Balls)

- **Terminal Rate**: ~3.0% in cyclical baseline (lower than US)
- **Growth Potential**: Decelerated to ~0.5% secular
- **Duration Preference**: Intermediate (2-5yr), avoid long end
- **Curve Strategy**: Bull steepening bias

### Currency Hedging (Balls/Iggo)

- PPP valuation for EUR tactical entry/exit
- Use forwards/swaps to separate rate risk from FX risk
- Monitor speculative EUR positioning for rebound signals

## 6. Green Bond Evaluation (Iggo Four Pillars)

| Pillar | Core Question | Red Flag |
|--------|---------------|----------|
| **Strategic Alignment** | Fits issuer's overall environmental strategy? | Isolated, unrelated project |
| **Additionality** | Clear impact beyond business-as-usual? | Would happen anyway |
| **Transparency** | Proceeds ring-fenced for specific projects? | Vague use of proceeds |
| **Reporting** | Annual KPIs and measurable targets? | No accountability mechanism |

### ESG Integration (Kiesel/Iggo)

- **Exclusion Criteria**: >10% revenue from coal, weapons, tobacco, pornography
- **Sovereign Exclusion**: Bottom 15% of transparency indices
- **Governance Priority**: Most important ESG pillar for credit decisions
- **Biodiversity**: Emerging "biodiversity footprint" metric
- **Correlation**: Higher ESG scores = better credit ratings

---

## 7. Structured Credit & ABF

### Why Structured Credit (Minerd/Gundlach)

- **Complexity Premium**: Higher yields than similarly-rated corporates
- **Structural Seniority**: Contractual cash flow priority
- **Liquidity Mitigation**: Underrepresented in benchmarks, less "vanishing liquidity"
- **Performance**: Guggenheim Structured Credit returned 18.5% annualized (2008-2016)

### Asset Classes

| Class | Characteristics | Key Metric |
|-------|-----------------|------------|
| **Agency MBS** | "Gold Standard," government backing | Spread vs Treasuries at percentile ranks |
| **Non-Agency RMBS** | Loan-level analysis, home equity protection | LTV ratios, "utterly nonexistent" default in high equity |
| **CLOs** | Middle-market loans, senior tranches | Structural seniority, covenant packages |
| **ABS** | Auto, student, credit card | Cash flow analysis over ratings |
| **CMBS** | Commercial real estate, barbell approach | Property underwriting, LTV ratios |

### MBS Convexity Strategy (Gundlach)

- Select pools with reduced negative convexity
- **High LTV (>100%)**: Borrowers can't refinance = yield protection
- **HARP Loans**: Refinancing constraints protect yield-to-maturity
- **Low Loan Balance**: Less incentive to refinance

## 8. Sell Triggers & Red Flags

### Universal Sell Triggers

| Trigger | Action | Source |
|---------|--------|--------|
| Rising Star realized | Sell after upgrade (value captured) | Kiesel |
| Curve de-inversion (12-mo MA > 0) | Reduce risk, recession imminent | Gundlach |
| Shareholder-friendly pivot | Exit (LBOs, buybacks, dividend hikes) | Kiesel |
| Interest Coverage < 1.5x | Immediate review/exit | Michele |
| Sovereign CDS > 500 bps | Liquidity cliff—sell/hedge | Gross |
| Net Debt/EBITDA > 5.0x | Exit trigger | Michele |

### Five Systemic Red Flags

1. **BBB Cliff**: BBB = 2x HY market; downgrade wave would crash spreads even without defaults
2. **Liquidity Illusion**: Dealer inventory 90% below 2007; "vanish when needed most"
3. **Marking to Fantasy**: Private credit at 100 cents until sudden drop to zero
4. **Covenant Erosion**: "Systematic decline in quality"—spreads don't reflect lost protections
5. **Debt Trap**: Government interest expense → money printing → inflation → higher rates

### Private Credit Warning Signs (Gundlach)

- "Next major financial crisis candidate"
- Marks remain at 100 until zero
- No public market, illiquid assets
- Private equity borrowing from private credit = circular leverage
- Less transparency than public markets

## 9. Regime-Based Allocation

### Barbell Strategy (El-Erian)

| End | Allocation | Purpose |
|-----|------------|---------|
| **Defensive** | Cash (4-5%), short-duration quality | Optionality for dislocations |
| **Aggressive** | Structured credit, private credit, AI-related | Capture complexity premiums |
| **Avoid Middle** | Generic IG corporates at tight spreads | "Muddle through" offers poor risk/reward |

### Allocation by Regime

| Regime | Duration | Quality | Sector | Geography |
|--------|----------|---------|--------|-----------|
| **Rising Rates** | Short | MLPs, regional banks | Avoid long bonds | US preferred |
| **Falling Rates** | Extend (5yr sector) | MBS, roll-down | Treasuries | Global diversified |
| **Credit Widening** | Neutral | AAA CMBS/CLOs | Avoid BBB | Core Europe |
| **Credit Tightening** | Risk-on | BB HY, Rising Stars | EM local currency | Peripheral Europe |

### Michele 20/80 Blend

| Metric | 20% HY + 80% IG | IG Only |
|--------|-----------------|---------|
| Annualized Return | 5.50% | Lower |
| Volatility | 5.95% | Higher duration risk |
| Return-to-Vol Ratio | 0.92 | Lower |
| Duration Mitigation | Yes (higher coupons) | No |

### New Normal 2.0 Implications (El-Erian)

- **Supply-side constraint**: Inflation floor higher than pre-COVID
- **Bond-equity correlation**: May turn positive (no "free lunch")
- **Deglobalization**: "Just-in-case" > "just-in-time" = cost pressure
- **Central bank credibility**: "Overextended" from being "only game in town"
