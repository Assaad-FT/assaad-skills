description: Six universal investment principles from 16 legendary investors (Buffett, Munger, Klarman, Marks, Lynch, Dalio, Druckenmiller, Soros, Tudor Jones, Tepper, Burry, Pabrai). Use when discussing investment philosophy, evaluating any stock, or when the user needs foundational guidance on capital preservation, circle of competence, margin of safety, long-term orientation, cutting losses, or independent thinking.
---

# Core Investment Principles

## Principle 1: Capital Preservation

**Rule:** Avoiding permanent loss is more important than maximizing returns. Survival enables compounding.

**Quotes:**
- "Rule #1: Never lose money. Rule #2: Never forget Rule #1." — Buffett
- "Playing great defense is the most important thing." — Tudor Jones
- "Avoiding loss should be the primary goal of every investor." — Klarman

**Apply:**
- Require margin of safety before any purchase
- Never use leverage that could force liquidation
- Size positions so no single loss is catastrophic
- Maintain cash reserves

---

## Principle 2: Circle of Competence

**Rule:** Only invest in businesses you genuinely understand. Knowing boundaries matters more than size.

**Quotes:**
- "Know what you own and know why you own it." — Lynch
- "Tell me where I'm going to die so I don't go there." — Munger

**Test if in your circle:**
- Can you explain the business in one sentence?
- Do you understand how they make money?
- Can you identify the key risks?
- If NO to any → pass

---

## Principle 3: Margin of Safety

**Rule:** Buy at significant discount to intrinsic value to protect against errors and bad luck.

**Quotes:**
- "Price is what you pay. Value is what you get." — Buffett
- "No asset is so good it can't become bad at too high a price." — Marks

**Required margins:**
| Situation | Margin |
|-----------|--------|
| Wide moat + great mgmt | 15-20% |
| Good business | 25-35% |
| No moat / uncertain | 50%+ |
| Growth stocks | PEG < 1.0 |

---

## Principle 4: Long-Term Orientation

**Rule:** Think in years and decades. Patience is a competitive advantage.

**Quotes:**
- "Our favorite holding period is forever." — Buffett
- "The big money is in the waiting." — Livermore
- "Few bets, big bets, infrequent bets." — Pabrai

**Why it works:**
- Compounding works best uninterrupted
- Transaction costs and taxes erode returns
- Most investors cannot be patient — this is your edge

---

## Principle 5: Cut Losses; Let Winners Run

**Rule:** Exit quickly when thesis breaks; hold winners far longer than feels comfortable.

**Quotes:**
- "Selling winners and holding losers is like cutting flowers and watering weeds." — Lynch
- "Losers average losers." — Tudor Jones
- "Never average down." — Livermore

**Math:** A 50% loss requires 100% gain to break even. Asymmetry favors cutting losses.

---

## Principle 6: Independent Thinking

**Rule:** Superior returns require non-consensus views that turn out correct.

**Quotes:**
- "Be fearful when others are greedy, greedy when others are fearful." — Buffett
- "To achieve superior results, hold non-consensus views that turn out correct." — Marks

**Marks's Matrix:**
| | Wrong | Right |
|---|---|---|
| Consensus | Negative | Average |
| Non-Consensus | Disastrous | Superior |

name: investing-sell-discipline
description: When to sell (and NOT sell) based on Buffett, Lynch, Marks, Soros. Use when user asks "should I sell?", wants help with exit decisions, needs Lynch's category-specific sell rules, or is uncertain whether to hold or exit a position.
---

# Sell Discipline

## Mandatory Sell — Exit Immediately

- [ ] Thesis fundamentally broken (moat eroded, model failed)
- [ ] Fraud or serious accounting manipulation
- [ ] Management integrity compromised

---

## Conditional Sell — Evaluate

- [ ] Valuation exceeds fair value by 30%+
- [ ] Significantly better opportunity available
- [ ] Position grown to >15% concentration
- [ ] Lynch category rules triggered (see below)

---

## DO NOT Sell Just Because:

- [ ] Price dropped (thesis still intact)
- [ ] Short-term earnings miss
- [ ] Macro fears without specific impact
- [ ] Boredom
- [ ] Someone else sold

---

## Lynch's Category Sell Rules

| Category | Sell When |
|----------|-----------|
| Slow Grower | Dividend cut |
| Stalwart | After 30-50% gain |
| Fast Grower | Growth slowing; P/E > growth rate |
| Cyclical | Cycle peak; inventory building |
| Turnaround | Recovery complete |
| Asset Play | Assets recognized; stock ≈ NAV |

---

## Sell Decision Process

1. Re-read original buy thesis
2. Ask: "Has thesis changed, or just price?"
3. Ask: "Would I buy today at this price?"
4. If selling, write specific reason
5. Determine use of proceeds BEFORE selling
6. Consider tax implications
7. If unsure, wait 48 hours

---

## Common Mistakes

**Selling winners too early:**
"Selling winners and holding losers is like cutting flowers and watering weeds." — Lynch

**Holding losers too long:**
"Losers average losers." — Tudor Jones

**Selling on price drop alone:**
Price down 20% but business fine = buying opportunity, not sell signal.

---

## The Ultimate Test

1. Has the BUSINESS deteriorated, or just the stock price?
2. Would Buffett sell this?
3. Am I acting on analysis or emotion?
4. What will I do with proceeds?

# Position Sizing

## Conviction-Based Sizing

### VERY HIGH: 8-15%
- Wide moat + deep discount + clear catalyst
- Deep within circle of competence
- Used by: Buffett, Pabrai, Druckenmiller

### HIGH: 5-8%
- Strong business + good discount + solid thesis
- Used by: Most value investors

### MEDIUM: 3-5%
- Good business + moderate discount
- Used by: Lynch (stalwarts), Klarman

### LOWER: 1-3%
- Speculative / learning / testing thesis
- Used by: Soros (hypothesis test)

---

## Adjustments

| Situation | Action |
|-----------|--------|
| Macro uncertainty high | Reduce all sizes 20-30% |
| Crisis opportunity | Can exceed limits |
| New position | Start 50%, scale in |
| High correlation | Reduce size |

---

## Portfolio by Style

| Style | Positions | Max Single |
|-------|-----------|------------|
| Concentrated (Buffett, Pabrai) | 5-15 | 15-40% |
| Moderate (Klarman) | 15-25 | 5-10% |
| Diversified (Lynch) | 50-200 | 1-3% |

---

## Hard Limits

- Never >25% single position
- Never >50% single sector
- Always maintain 10%+ cash

---

## Scaling In (Pyramiding)

1. Initial: 1/3 of target size
2. Thesis confirming: Add 1/3
3. Full conviction: Complete position
4. If thesis weakens: Do NOT add

**Key:** Only add to winners, never to losers.

"Losers average losers." — Tudor Jones
